# Building/Flashing
Make sure you have the [esp32-camera driver](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera) repository in the component folder. You can clone this by running running `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`. This will clone the latest esp32-camera driver from the [repo](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera) into the components library for you.
